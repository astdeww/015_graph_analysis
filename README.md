# GRAPH ANALYSIS

Graph analysis involves examining the structures and properties of graphs in order to gain insights into their characteristics and the relationships between their elements. Graphs consist of **nodes (vertices)** and **edges (connections)**; and they are used to model pairwise relations between objects. Key concepts in graph analysis include:
1. **Degree**: The number of edges connected to a node.
2. **Path**: A sequence of edges that connects two nodes.
3. **Connected Components**: Subgraphs in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths.
4. **Centrality Measures**: Metrics to determine the importance of nodes (e.g., degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality).
5. **Community Detection**: Identifying clusters or groups of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph.
6. **Shortest Path**: Finding the minimum path length between nodes.
7. **Graph Isomorphism**: Determining if two graphs are structurally identical.
Graph analysis is used in various fields such as social network analysis, biology (e.g., studying protein interactions), computer networks, transportation, and many other areas where relationships between entities need to be understood.
